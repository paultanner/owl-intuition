owl-intuition
=============

OWL Intuition tools help you to use data from an OWL system in interesting ways.

owl_mon3.js runs in the same way but excepts a local mysql database to save the data.

(legacy) owl_mon_xively_cloud.js runs in the cloud under node.js. It sends to Xively so you need and account there.

Your OWL must be configured to send to the correct server and port of course (see Settings/Set Up Data Push in your OWL console)

This version is intentionally minimal, but of course you can add whatever channels your OWL device has available.

OWL does not send accumulated energy (except daily).  Some code for generating that is included.
